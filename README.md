 **KapdaVerse 🧵✨**

**KapdaVerse** is a simple two-page frontend prototype built to explore how a modern fashion website can look when design, simplicity, and user-experience come together.
It reflects my interest in blending **fashion + tech + clean UI development**.

## **📄 Pages**

### **1. `index.html` – Homepage**

* Main landing page
* Introduces the KapdaVerse concept
* Clean and minimal UI

### **2. `start.html` – Next Page**

* Continuation of the homepage flow
* Shows how the user journey progresses
* Maintains the same aesthetic and layout style

## **💡 Purpose of This Project**

I built KapdaVerse as a beginner-friendly project to:

* Practice and showcase frontend skills
* Build a small but meaningful UI prototype
* Start visualizing my long-term idea of a fashion-tech brand
* Create a foundation that can later grow into a full e-commerce platform

## **✨ Key Advantages**

* Shows my ability to design **simple, responsive UI**
* Demonstrates my interest in building brand-focused experiences
* A clean project to highlight in my portfolio or resume
* Easy to scale into more features (products, cart, login, etc.)
* Reflects my creativity + coding skills coming together
